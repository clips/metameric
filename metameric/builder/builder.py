class Builder(object):
    """
    A factory class that builds networks.

    A Builder takes as input a bunch of basic parameters in the constructor,
    and then creates a network based on the data which is put into the model.

    In machine learning terms, the builder can be thought of as a trainer,
    which returns a fully trained model based on the input data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : dict
        A dictionary with tuples as keys. The first item of the tuple is the
        from layer, the second the to layer. Each value is also a tuple, the
        first value of which is the positive weight, and the second value of
        which is the negative weight.

        Example:
            {("orthography", "letters"): [.01, -.01]}
    rla : dict
        A dictionary specifying which fields are used to establish the variable
        RLA for each layer that has a variable RLA.
    global_rla : float
        The global RLA. This value is assigned to all non-variable RLA layers,
        and is used to scale the global RLA layers.
    outputs : tuple
        The names of the layers which are used as output.
    monitors : tuple
        The names of the layers which are monitored for convergence.
    minimum : float
        The minimum activation.
    step_size : float
        The step size by which to scale the activation.
    decay_rate : float
        The decay rate.
